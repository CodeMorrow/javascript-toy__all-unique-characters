# Toy Problem - JavaScript

## Does a string contain all unique characters?

### Objectives

1. Practice thinking through abstract algorithms.
2. Properly use common data structures.

Write an algorithm that checks if a given string contains all unique characters. For example, if the algorithm is given `"bear"`, it should return `true`; but if it's given `"barometer"`, it should return false (because `"e"` is repeated in that word).
