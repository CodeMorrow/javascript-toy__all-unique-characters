# Toy Problem - JavaScript

## Does a string contain all unique characters?

### Objectives

1. Practice thinking through abstract algorithms.
2. Properly use common data structures.

Write an algorithm that checks if a given string contains all unique characters. For example, if the algorithm is given `"bear"`, it should return `true`; but if it's given `"barometer"`, it should return false (because `"e"` is repeated in that word).

### Getting Started

After forking this repo and opening it in your development environment (e.g. Cloud9), run `bin/setup`. This will install any software that this exercise depends upon.

Your work belongs in the **lib/** directory. Modify the function(s) in the provided JavaScript files. To check if you have passed this exercise, run `bin/check`. This will run a series of automated tests and provide you with errors and/or feedback.

Do not change the name of the function. Simply alter the body of the function to get the tests passing.
